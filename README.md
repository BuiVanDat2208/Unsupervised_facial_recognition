**1. data_loader.py**
Functionality:
Load and preprocess data from the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.
Libraries:
numpy:
Handles numerical data arrays and supports operations on image data.
sklearn.datasets.fetch_lfw_people:
Loads the LFW dataset, including facial images and corresponding labels.
sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler:
Standardizes data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, improving the performance of machine learning algorithms.
Algorithms:
Data Standardization:
Normalizes pixel values of images to ensure equal contribution from each feature when performing dimensionality reduction or clustering.
**2. pca.py**
Functionality:
Reduce data dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Libraries:
sklearn.decomposition.PCA:
Provides the PCA algorithm for dimensionality reduction.
Algorithms:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Reduces data dimensionality by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional space while retaining most of the variance.
Computes the covariance matrix, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors to identify principal components.
**3. kmeans.py**
Functionality:
Perform clustering using K-Means and Spectral Clustering.
Libraries:
sklearn.cluster.KMeans:
Implements the K-Means clustering algorithm based on Euclidean distance.
sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering:
Implements Spectral Clustering, which leverages graph-based methods for nonlinear data structures.
Algorithms:
K-Means Clustering:
Finds 
ùëò
k clusters by iteratively optimizing cluster centroids and assigning data points to the nearest cluster.
Spectral Clustering:
Constructs an affinity matrix and uses graph analysis to cluster data based on connectivity.
**4. utils.py**
Functionality:
Display results and visualize data.
Libraries:
matplotlib.pyplot:
Creates plots and visualizations.
numpy:
Processes numerical arrays (passed in from other modules).
Algorithms:
No direct algorithms implemented, but it visualizes results from PCA, K-Means, and Spectral Clustering:
PCA variance plot.
K-Means clustering scatter plot.
